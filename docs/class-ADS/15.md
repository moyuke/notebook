1.Suppose we have the internal memory that can handle 12 numbers at a time, and the following two runs on the tapes:

Run 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12

Run 2: 2, 4, 6, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32

Use 2-way merge with 4 input buffers and 2 output buffers for parallel operations. Which of the following three operations are NOT done in parallel?

(3分)

A.1 and 2 are written onto the third tape; 3 and 4 are merged into an output buffer; 6 and 15 are read into an input buffer

B.3 and 4 are written onto the third tape; 5 and 6 are merged into an output buffer; 8 and 9 are read into an input buffer

C.5 and 6 are written onto the third tape; 7 and 8 are merged into an output buffer; 20 and 25 are read into an input buffer

D.7 and 8 are written onto the third tape; 9 and 15 are merged into an output buffer; 10 and 12 are read into an input buffer

工作原理：buffer 一个一个按顺序被写。两个run轮流对buffer进行写。

需要注意的是：如果之前有没有merge完成的，比较复杂，需要等待。

一共4+2个buffer, 内存有12个数，因此每个buffer2个数。六个buffer,后两个是输出的

这题A描述的是3->4, B描述的是4->5，C描述的是5->6, D错在不是9和15 merge, 9和10 merge
